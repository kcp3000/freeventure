# Agile Methodology Reflection

## Prompt 
As a group, answer the questions below. For each of these questions, consider specific examples to support your narrative.

* Reflect on your team's communication processes. How did Agile practices, such as **daily stand-up** meetings, facilitate communication and collaboration among team members?
  Our communication process was good. We both communicated what we were working on. One team member took the role of a program manager/scrum master. The other team member would deliver what they had to do on that same day.

* How did maintaining a **scrum board** play a role in the organization and delegation of tasks in your project?
  The scrum board helped us have a visual of our tasks done and the amount of things we had left.

* Reflect on your team's prioritization of tasks. How did your team create a **timeline for reaching MVP** and how did this prioritization assist in accomplishing your goals?
  We created a timeline by communicating our ideas on what we wanted the website to have then using this information to organize what we wanted to work on first. As well as having deadlines on the work we disccussed. The prioritization assited in accomplishing our goals because we made sure we were done with what we needed first before moving on to the following task, whiched helped us have work that was fully completed before moving on. 

* What would you have done differently as a group to improve your communication, prioritization, or delegation of tasks?
  What I would have done differently is for us to be more clear on our style of css.

**Write your reflection using markdown**.
